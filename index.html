        <p><b>Update: JSowlrdGen should now work faster</b></p>
        <p>The terrain generation of JSworldgen used square roots to calculate the distance between each pixel an each heightpoint. Square roots need much time to be calculated, and because it needs to calculate +- 3000 distances per pixel, it slows down the algorithim quite a bit. You can also calculate the distance by simply not putting the sqrt() around the scuared distances along the 2 axises. This does result in the new function not returning the actual distance, but a much heigher value that is still usable. Also the max amount of calculations per frame is now not limited by a fixed value, but instead the algorithim keeps on calculating new pixels untill 25ms since the last frame have passed. This results in a max framerate of 40FPS, wich is enough to my opinion.</p>

        <p><b>Update: Math plotter can now show RGB colors</b></p>
        <p>I updated MathPoltter to now accept arrays of 3 items and show the values of the items in different colors. This only applies when using something like "return [Redval, Blueval, Greenval]". You can now only give integers, but in the future you can also return booleans in the array. When returning only a integer or a boolean, the old behavior applies. All old functions should still work.<br>
        You can with some smart JS still use booleans with the new color channels. This can be done by first calculation the boolean and next use an if-statement to turn it into an integer. This function plots a red and a green line, with a blue circle at (0,0). "var myBlue = (dist(0,0,x,y) < 100); if (myBlue) {myBlue = 255;} else {myBlue = 0;} return [abs(y-(x*2+5))*-1+255, abs(y-(x*-2-5))*-1+255, myBlue]"<br>
        I also fixed a bug: Math returning integers was plotted upsideDown. The solution also improves the performance ;).</p>

        <p><b>releasing math plotter</b></p>
        <p>I modified JSWorldGen to now plot any mathematical equation. You can move around by swiping/dragging or using WASD. To set the shown formula, press the + icon on the top left and enter a javascript function in the popup. For example "return x+y" or "return y/(x%255)". The <a href="https://p5js.org/reference/#group-Math">p5.js</a> library is also available in these functions, for example "return dist(0,0,x,y)" or "return noise(x/100, y/100)*255". NOTE: if your function returns a integer, it must be between 0 and 255. if not, the value will be lowerd/higherd to be inside this range. TIP: at the end of your function add "%255". this makes sure that the returned value is in between 0 and 255. Try "return dist(0,0,x,y)%255" to understand it's effect better.<br>
           You can also let your function return booleans, for example "return x == y" or "return round(dist(0,0,x,y)) == 100" </p>

        <p><b>JS WorldGen update</b></p>
        <p>I updated JSWorldGen to now calculate the terrain in chunks. You can now move around in the world using WASD controls or by swiping/dragging. In the coming updates a zoom function and maybe also 3d rendering.<br>
        I will also be reusing the generation engine to be able to plot mathmatical functions.</p>

        <p>I am currently working on multiple projects at once: A time travel simulator, making JSworldgen work with chunks, to allow infinite terrain generation, and playing around with <a href="https://processing.org/" target="_blank">Processing</a>, a library for Java (not JavaScript), where I can test out some algorithim concepts for future games and programs.<br>
        I have also fixed a bug in the SpaceGame: Enemies did not respawn, now this works properly again. I am cleaning up the code to allow future expansion of the game.</p>

        <p>An other update for the JSrunner game. Now, when pressing 'O' a menu will pop up where you can enter a web url for an image. The image linked will replace the look of obstacles. This is an other step closer to the ability to completly customise the game. I also fixed two bugs, one is that you did not take damage from obstacles while crouching on the ground, and second that the highscores of JSrunner and space game where shared on 1 name, which caused some problems. I changed the names, but your highscores on both games will reset.</p>

        <p><a href="https://midasscheffers.github.io" target="_blank">Midas</a> and I thought that Space Invander was nearing its release. We where thinking about a upgrade system with items and crafting, but we rememberd that the original plan for this game was to be a retro game, simple and fun. To my opinion the Space Game at its current state is a good and fun retro game, so I release it. Of course we will keep improving the game engine and maby make it compatible for mobile devices, but don't expext any other new game changing futures for the game.
        <br>I am planning to work on some random smaller projects, catching op with school and maybe start a Youtube channel.</p>
