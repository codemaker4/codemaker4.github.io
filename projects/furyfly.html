                <a href="https://codemaker4.github.io/fury-fly/" target="_blank">Fury Fly in the Witches' Kitchen</a> is a local 2 player platformer game where you are a fly that is so thick that it can only jump. The theme of the Game Jam was '30 seconds', so after 30 seconds the kitchen will flood with deadly water.<br>
                The controls are WASD for player 1, and arrow keys for plater two. The goal is to stay alive as long as possible by nocking your opponent off the screen or into the water.<br>

                This project was made together with three others in about 8 hours. <a href="https://github.com/leahcrozier" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Leah</a> and <a href="http://luuknoverraz.nl/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Luuk</a> did most of the pixel-art and pages for the main-menu and the win screen, while <a href="http://www.jochembaas.nl/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Jochem</a> and I did the programming of the game itself.<br>
                Initially, we wanted this to become an online multiplayer game, which can be seen in some of the decisions in the code. The unused server.js and socket.js (for the client) are also still in the repo. But when multiplayer still wasn't working around one hour before the deadline, we decided to cancel online multiplayer and make it a local multiplayer game instead. At this point, all the platforming physics and graphics were already finished, but having two players in the same world was never tested before. So it was quite the surprise when it only took 15 minutes to make the two players function properly and the game was basically done and already surprisingly fun to play. We spent some more time polishing, slightly tweaking the physics and adding the awesome sound effects. After the Game-Jam I did some extra polishing and bugfixing, but the gameplay itself stayed the same.
