            <p>
                Over 2 years after the planned release date it is finally here: The SMPU.<br>
                As said in <a href="https://youtu.be/1sWROXDEdEg" target="_blank">my latest YouTube video</a>, the SMPU is an 8 bit computer in vanilla Scrap Mechanic. But unlike <a href="SMC1.html" target="_blank">my previous computer</a> it has external memory with a 16 bit address, allowing you to trivially hook it up to over 64 kilobytes of data, or use that address space for controlling other devices.<br>
                I also made <a href="http://codemaker4.com/codemakers-assembler/" target="_blank">a custom assembler</a> to make it easier to make programs for the SMPU, and <a href="https://github.com/niknal357" target="_blank">Niknal</a> (a member of my <a href=" https://discord.gg/Es4pC7mb4v" target="_blank">Discord server</a>) made an emulator for it. (And he found some inconsistancies in my documentation) Thanks Niknal!<br>

                But as explained in the <a href="https://youtu.be/x1sD57Rx178" target="_blank">tutorial video</a>, I don't really like the SMPU. I fully designed and mostly built the SMPU over two years ago, but then just forgot about it. Since then, I have learned many things that let me see the many flaws the SMPU has. But I decided to finish it anyway, and not change the design. Instead, I hope to learn from my mistakes by actually using the SMPU and research what the flaws actually are and how to fix them. Then, I can build a better computer soon, maybe...
